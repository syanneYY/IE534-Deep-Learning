# Understanding CNNs and Generative Adversarial Networks

The assignment consists of training a Generative Adversarial Network on the CIFAR10 dataset as well as a few visualization tasks for better understanding how a CNN works.

- Train a baseline model for CIFAR10 classification (~2 hours training time)
- Train a discriminator/generator pair on CIFAR10 dataset utilizing techniques from ACGAN and Wasserstein GANs (~40-45 hours training time)
- Use techniques to create synthetic images maximizing class output scores or particular features as a visualization technique to understand how a CNN is working (<1 minute)


This homework is slightly different than previous homeworks as you will be provided with a lot of code and sets of hyperparameters. You should only need to train the models once after you piece together the code and understand how it works. The second part of the homework (feature visualization) utilizes the models trained from part 1. The output will need to be run many times with various parameters but the code is extremely fast.
